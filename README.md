## Hot keys

Press Enter on the keyboard if you want to write a text or code from the new row.
It also adds new bullet point if you edit a bullet list.

It also allows to finish bullet list and start writing a regular text.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ezetech/anthropic-gui.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
yarn
```

3. Run the app

```
yarn start:dev
```

or if you want to open it in browser
```
yarn start
```

4. Enter your API key to use the app

## Build

To build the app for your OS, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux in the `dist` folder.
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## More available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
